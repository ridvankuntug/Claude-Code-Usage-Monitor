## Custom Fork Notes

This repository is a custom fork of [`CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor`](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor). It is not the official CodeZeno release.

Differences from upstream:

- Adds a Claude Desktop local usage history fallback for Claude Code. It runs only when upstream's Claude polling ends in a credential or login failure (no CLI or desktop app token, an expired or rejected login); if it finds nothing, the original upstream error is shown unchanged. Other failures (network, rate limits, server and other HTTP errors, unexpected responses) keep upstream's stale-reading and retry behavior.
- Reads only `plan-usage-history.json` from the Claude Desktop data directories upstream already knows (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-Data\claude_*`, `%APPDATA%\Claude`, MSIX `Packages\Claude_*\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude`) plus `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude`.
- Maps the newest sample's `u.fh` value to the 5-hour usage percentage and `u.sd` to the 7-day usage percentage, clamped to 0-100.
- Leaves reset timestamps empty for that fallback because Claude Desktop history does not include exact reset times.
- Applies the fallback only to the default Claude profile, the same scope upstream uses for the desktop app token, and not when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set; custom account profiles keep upstream behavior.
- While the fallback supplies usage, the sign-in prompt and auth pause for that failure are not shown.
- Adds tests for newest-sample selection, percentage clamping, samples without timestamps, path discovery, file selection, profile scoping, and error preservation.
- Adds a local maintenance guide for carrying this change forward after upstream updates.
- Adds a custom GitHub Actions build that publishes a `custom-latest` prerelease from the `claude-desktop-history-fallback` branch.
- Adds a PowerShell installer for downloading that custom build from this fork.

The in-app updater still checks the official CodeZeno releases. Installing an update from it replaces this custom build with the official release, which does not include the fallback.

Maintenance and reapply notes are in [`docs/claude-desktop-history-fallback-maintenance.md`](docs/claude-desktop-history-fallback-maintenance.md).

## Features

- Displays current usage and time remaining until each limit resets
- Counts usage up from zero or down from the full allowance, whichever you prefer
- Supports Claude Code, Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, Cursor, Grok Build, and GitHub Copilot
- Supports multiple accounts for Claude Code and Codex
- Lives in the Windows taskbar with quick controls in the system tray
- Supports multiple monitors and Windows startup
- Includes configurable refresh intervals, providers, languages, and updates
- Provides built-in themes and a visual Theme Studio for custom layouts
- Collects no analytics or telemetry

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- At least one supported provider installed and signed in

Claude Code credentials can be detected from the CLI, Claude desktop app, or WSL. Other providers are optional and can be enabled independently from the dashboard.

## Installation

GitHub Actions creates a plain portable `.exe` after every push to this fork's custom branch.

Download the latest custom exe:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/ridvankuntug/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/releases/download/custom-latest/claude-code-usage-monitor.exe -OutFile .\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe
```

Run it directly:

```powershell
.\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe
```

For diagnostics:

```powershell
.\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe --diagnose
```

Optional one-command install with a Start Menu shortcut:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "install-claude-code-usage-monitor-custom.ps1"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ridvankuntug/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/claude-desktop-history-fallback/scripts/install-custom.ps1 -OutFile $installer; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer -Repo ridvankuntug/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor
```

That optional installer places the exe at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitorCustom\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe` and adds a **Claude Code Usage Monitor Custom** Start Menu shortcut. Installed-build diagnostics:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitorCustom\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe" --diagnose
```

The commands in the sections below assume the executable is on your `PATH`; otherwise run it by its full path.

### Official upstream release

Do not use `winget install CodeZeno.ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor` or the [CodeZeno GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/releases) for this fork. They install the official CodeZeno release, not this custom Claude Desktop history fallback build.

See [updater verification](docs/updater.md) for the portable updater's integrity checks and trust boundary.

## Usage

Start the monitor:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor
```

Open the settings dashboard directly:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --dashboard
```

Use the dashboard to select providers, change the refresh interval, choose a display, enable startup, or customize the widget. **Settings > Display > Usage direction** switches the default theme and other themes that support this setting between showing what has been used and what is left, with Used as the default. Selecting Remaining makes a fresh limit read 100% and drain as you work.

Theme authors can opt in with `.display` bindings, including `{claude.session.display:usage_line}` and `{claude.session.display:usage_badge}`. Existing `.percentage`, `.remaining`, and unsuffixed usage summaries keep their meaning; warning thresholds should continue to use `.percentage`.

In the default theme, left-click a provider tray icon to show or hide the widget and right-click it to open the menu.

## Provider setup

| Provider | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Sign in with the Claude Code CLI or desktop app. Windows and WSL credentials are detected automatically. |
| Codex | Install and sign in to the Codex CLI, then enable Codex in **Providers**. |
| Google Antigravity | Sign in to Antigravity, then enable it in **Providers**. |
| OpenCode Go | Connect an OpenCode Go account, configure the credentials described below, then enable OpenCode in **Providers**. |
| Cursor | Sign in to Cursor, then enable it in **Providers**. The local session is detected automatically. |
| Grok Build | Run `grok login` in the Grok Build CLI, then enable Grok in **Providers**. The signed-in session is detected automatically. |
| GitHub Copilot | Sign in with the Copilot CLI (`copilot`, then `/login`) or the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`), then enable Copilot in **Providers**. The stored login is detected automatically. |

For OpenCode Go, set `OPENCODE_GO_WORKSPACE_ID` and `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE`, or create `%APPDATA%\opencode-go\config.json`:

```json
{
  "workspaceId": "wrk_01...",
  "authCookie": "__Host-console_session=your-session-cookie-value"
}
```

The workspace ID is part of the OpenCode Go console URL: `https://opencode.ai/console/<workspaceId>/go`. Copy the `__Host-console_session` cookie from an authenticated `opencode.ai` browser session, including its name as shown above. A full Cookie header containing `__Host-console_session` or the legacy `auth` cookie is also accepted unchanged; no empty `auth=;` prefix is needed. Bare legacy `auth` cookie values remain supported. These formats work for both `authCookie` and `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE`. Set `OPENCODE_GO_CONFIG_FILE` to use a different config path. The monitor reads usage from the console JSON API using this workspace ID and cookie.

For Cursor, `CURSOR_SESSION_TOKEN` can override the automatically detected local session.

Grok Build usage comes from the session the CLI stores in `%USERPROFILE%\.grok\auth.json`, read through the same billing endpoint as the CLI's own `/usage` panel. Set `GROK_HOME` if the CLI keeps its home directory elsewhere. Only xAI sign-in entries are used; corporate identity-provider tokens and stored API keys are excluded. A bare `XAI_API_KEY` is not enough: the shared weekly allowance is only readable with a signed-in session. Grok reports one pool per billing period rather than a five-hour window, so the monitor shows it on the long-window row alongside the other providers, leaving the short-window row empty. On-demand spending replaces the pool on that row once any is used, as it already does for Claude Code and Codex.

GitHub Copilot usage comes from `api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`, the endpoint Copilot's own editors and CLI read. The monitor uses the first GitHub login that endpoint accepts, in this order: the `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, the Copilot CLI login, then the GitHub CLI login, both read from Windows Credential Manager. Copilot spends one premium-request pool per calendar month, so the monitor shows it on the long-window row and leaves the short-window row empty. Metered chat and completion allowances, as on Copilot Free, are available to themes through `copilot.limits.chat` and `copilot.limits.completions`.

## Data and privacy

The monitor reads local sign-in credentials for enabled providers and sends usage requests directly to their official services. It has no backend service, collects no telemetry, and does not upload credentials or project files.

Credentials are read without modifying the provider files that contain them. When Grok Build rejects a stored token, the monitor asks the Grok CLI to refresh its own session rather than rewriting `auth.json` itself. OpenCode Go credentials saved in a JSON configuration file are plain text and should be protected like a browser session cookie.

## Troubleshooting

Hover over the tray icon for the latest failure reason, or check the account
status under **Settings > Providers > Accounts**. Missing credentials, expired
or rejected logins, network failures, HTTP errors, and unexpected usage responses
have distinct messages. Sign in again using the Claude desktop app or the CLI
that owns the affected account, then refresh the monitor.

Open **Diagnostics** in the dashboard and enable recording to inspect or copy
polling errors. Logging is optional; enable it before reproducing the problem.

Run diagnostics with:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --diagnose
```

The diagnostic log is written to `%TEMP%\claude-code-usage-monitor.log`. Application settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json`.

If the app unexpectedly closes because of a Rust panic, it automatically appends
the panic message, source location, and thread details to the same log, even when
diagnostic recording is off. Copy the log before starting a new `--diagnose`
session, which clears it. Review and redact credentials, account identifiers,
and personal information before sharing relevant excerpts in a crash report.

## Build from source

Install [Rust via rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then run:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The repository pins Rust 1.95.0 in `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup automatically
selects this version. CI uses the same version. When upgrading Rust, update
`rust-toolchain.toml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, and the `rust-version`
in `Cargo.toml` together.

The executable will be created at `target\release\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe`.

Windows MSVC builds statically link the C runtime through `.cargo/config.toml`,
including release builds in CI. The executable does not require a separate
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installation; it still uses built-in Windows
system libraries.

See [dependency security](docs/dependency-security.md) for automated dependency
updates, CI security checks, and the commands to run those checks locally.
